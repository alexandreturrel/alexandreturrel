👋 Hi, I’m @alexandreturrel

I hope you're doing great!

Some little informations about myself:
- 👀 I’m interested in IoT and Smart Buildings more precisely
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Docker, K8s and some DevOps tools to easily deliver monitoring stacks as ELK (for now) and I'm soon gonna try it with Grafana and InfluxDB
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple IoT projects on Home Automation
- 📫 How to reach me: @al_xande_trl on Twitter & Instagram

Have a nice day!
